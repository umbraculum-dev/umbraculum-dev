# Umbraculum documentation

**Tier:** Public

This folder is the canonical reference set for the Umbraculum platform. It is structured so that anyone — a new contributor, a self-hoster, a hosted-service customer, or a future maintainer — can find what they need without reading the whole repository.

Documents are grouped by **purpose**, not by physical location. Most files sit at the top level — they have not been moved into per-purpose subfolders in order to keep cross-links inside the existing codebase stable; this index provides the navigation. The exceptions are `integrations/`, `calculators/` (pre-existing per-asset folders), `archive/` (superseded revisions), and `help/` (end-user / operator help, currently empty placeholder).

> **Audience tier.** All documents in this folder are **Tier: Public** by default — written to be surfaceable when the repository flips public. The first content line of each doc carries an explicit `**Tier:** Public` marker for clarity. Other tier values reserved for future use: `Partner-restricted`, `Customer-restricted`. Documentation that is not public-tier lives outside this folder and outside any public-mirror flip; it is intentionally not indexed here.

## Start here

If you are new to the project, read these documents in order:

0. [`GLOSSARY.md`](GLOSSARY.md) — **terminology first** (recommended if *vertical*, *canonical*, or *brewery* are unfamiliar): plain-language definitions, the brewery reference-vertical convention, and links to deeper docs.
1. [`PLATFORM-ARCHITECTURE.md`](PLATFORM-ARCHITECTURE.md) — the **vision and shape**: horizontal platform with vertical modules, AI consultant blueprint, BYOK + paid tier unlock, and the future managed-AI path.
2. [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) — the **direction of travel**: what is shipped, what is next, the 12–30 month trajectory.
3. [`LICENSING.md`](LICENSING.md) — the **licensing posture and reasoning**: AGPLv3 core + MIT SDK, commercial dual license, and what these choices imply for contributors, self-hosters, module developers, and enterprises.

**Student, capstone team, or university lab?** [`ACADEMIC-AND-EXPERIMENTATION.md`](ACADEMIC-AND-EXPERIMENTATION.md) — free self-host experimentation, suggested project shapes, alpha expectations, and an honest fit filter (brochure entry point links here).

**Building product X on Umbraculum (vertical ISV / integrator, not core contributor)?** [`BUILDING-YOUR-VERTICAL.md`](BUILDING-YOUR-VERTICAL.md) — start your vertical, omit brewery, Magento sample-data parallel.

Cross-platform (web + native + Ubuntu Touch webapp shell) boundaries: [`CROSS-PLATFORM-BOUNDARIES.md`](CROSS-PLATFORM-BOUNDARIES.md), [`design/ubuntu-touch-shell-strategy.md`](design/ubuntu-touch-shell-strategy.md). The brewery reference vertical's product rules: [`modules/verticals/brewery/IMPLEMENTATION-LOG.md`](modules/verticals/brewery/IMPLEMENTATION-LOG.md). Together they complement the platform-wide perspective above.

## Repository structure

*Audience: new contributors, evaluators, prospective module developers, future maintainers running an orientation pass.*

The spatial map of the monorepo — what every workspace is, which layer it sits in, what consumes it, and what it consumes. Read this once before diving into any specific module or slice.

- [`REPOSITORY-STRUCTURE.md`](REPOSITORY-STRUCTURE.md) — **the spatial map.** Five-layer mental model (apps → services → horizontal infrastructure packages → contracts packages → module SDK + vertical-flavored packages), workspace inventory tables, β-layout walkthrough for a single module, Mermaid dependency diagram, and the canonical-for-now docs publishing URL (`docs.umbraculum.dev`). Complements [`MODULES.md`](MODULES.md) (ecosystem) and [`PLATFORM-ARCHITECTURE.md`](PLATFORM-ARCHITECTURE.md) (architecture).

## Vision & strategy

*Audience: technical decision-makers, platform evaluators, future module developers.*

The high-level direction, business model, and license posture.

- [`GLOSSARY.md`](GLOSSARY.md) — **onboarding terminology** — *vertical*, *canonical*, *brewery (reference vertical)*, operator shell, and the doc convention for citing brewery.
- [`PLATFORM-ARCHITECTURE.md`](PLATFORM-ARCHITECTURE.md) — Platform vision, AI consultant, distribution model; §2.1 *From practice, not theory* (open backbone — practitioner rationale, cites Omnis case study).
- [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) — Living roadmap with 12–30 month trajectory.
- [`LICENSING.md`](LICENSING.md) — Licensing rationale (AGPLv3 + MIT SDK, dual license, RFC change process).
- [`TIER-PRICING-ANALYSIS.md`](TIER-PRICING-ANALYSIS.md) — Base subscription tiers and pricing analysis (the current AI tier unlock and future managed-AI overlay are described in `PLATFORM-ARCHITECTURE.md` §7).
- [`CORE-DEVELOPMENT-AND-COMMUNITY.md`](CORE-DEVELOPMENT-AND-COMMUNITY.md) — How community proposals, collaborators, sponsors, and AI-compute support fit into core development without buying priority or governance rights; canonical channels at `forum.umbraculum.dev` (§4.6); bootstrap infra custody and entity-owned migration via backup + restore (§4.6.7); authentic representation in community discourse (§6.1 — no AI impersonation of members); donation rails and environmental accounting (Stripe Climate 1%, forest stewardship) in [`design/donation-channels.md`](design/donation-channels.md) §9.
- [`design/ecosystem-case-study-omnis.md`](design/ecosystem-case-study-omnis.md) — **Ecosystem lesson (Omnis).** Good product; Core vs verticals governance, 2016 doc-site fragility (§3.4–§3.6); maps to community, open repos, and free-try commitments.
- [`design/ecosystem-case-studies.md`](design/ecosystem-case-studies.md) — **Index** for all practitioner ecosystem case studies (learnability, repositioning, no-cert policy).
- [`design/ecosystem-case-study-business-central.md`](design/ecosystem-case-study-business-central.md) — **Integration lesson (Business Central).** Large partner ecosystem, opaque external API surface (OData vs REST vs custom API, version/wave maze, consultants who cannot advise integrators); maps to Umbraculum's contracts packages, module route docs, and alpha partial OpenAPI ([`API-OPENAPI.md`](API-OPENAPI.md)).
- [`design/ecosystem-case-study-sap.md`](design/ecosystem-case-study-sap.md) — **Learnability lesson (SAP ABAP).** One language across verticals, but trials ≠ safe boat for repositioning; maps to free try, no certification program, expertise-over-badges ([`MANIFESTO.md`](../MANIFESTO.md) §2.2).
- [`design/ecosystem-case-study-teamsystem.md`](design/ecosystem-case-study-teamsystem.md) — **Learnability lesson (TeamSystem).** European ERP strength, partner-only experiment path; pairs with Omnis.
- [`design/ecosystem-case-study-odoo.md`](design/ecosystem-case-study-odoo.md) — **Learnability lesson (Odoo Community).** Partial positive — Community Edition tryability; Umbraculum copies the ladder, not the cert/partner gate; §4.1 platform-shape vs Odoo (language, native, breadth).
- [`design/ecosystem-case-study-adobe-magento.md`](design/ecosystem-case-study-adobe-magento.md) — **Stewardship lesson (Adobe → Magento).** ece-tools deploy integration vs agency-owned CI (§3.5); Mage-OS fork; always-green public-repo CI ([`MANIFESTO.md`](../MANIFESTO.md) §2.1).
- [`design/ecosystem-case-study-drupal-wordpress.md`](design/ecosystem-case-study-drupal-wordpress.md) — **Stewardship positive (Drupal + WordPress).** Modularity and community longevity; WordPress auth plugin hell → RFC-0001 Decision F; Drupal core-scale debate left open (§6).
- [`design/ecosystem-case-study-custom-vertical-code.md`](design/ecosystem-case-study-custom-vertical-code.md) — **Code and empathy lesson (unnamed platforms).** Agency delivery split; custom code as upgrade bottleneck; priesthood unmaintainability; client supplier-quality questions; Shopify contrast.
- [`PUBLIC-ALPHA-ANNOUNCEMENT.md`](PUBLIC-ALPHA-ANNOUNCEMENT.md) — Maintainer draft for the July 2026 public-alpha launch post (do not publish until flip).

## Modules ecosystem

*Audience: anyone evaluating, contributing to, or building on top of the module set — the analog of `drupal.org/project/project_module` for Umbraculum.*

- [`BUILDING-YOUR-VERTICAL.md`](BUILDING-YOUR-VERTICAL.md) — **foundational ISV path** — "how do I build product X on Umbraculum?" and "how do I run without brewery?" (Magento sample-data parallel; today vs target).
- [`MODULES.md`](MODULES.md) — **entry point for the module ecosystem.** Vocabulary (`package` vs `canonical module` vs `vertical configuration` vs `reserved canonical code` vs `module SDK`), the catalog (canonical modules + vertical configurations + horizontal packages), the "I want to build a ___" decision tree, and a worked example. See also [`GLOSSARY.md`](GLOSSARY.md) for plain-language onboarding definitions.
- [`modules/`](modules/) — per-module pages linked from `MODULES.md` (one page per canonical module / vertical configuration as each ships; today: `modules/canonical/automation.md`, `modules/canonical/pim.md`, and the `modules/verticals/brewery/` reference vertical docs).
- [`modules/packages/README.md`](modules/packages/README.md) — **package primer** — horizontal infrastructure, canonical contracts, and vertical-flavored workspaces with links to each `README.md`.

## AI consultant

*Audience: platform evaluators, hosted-service operators, module developers, end-users.*

The workspace-scope AI consultant is the cornerstone the platform is organized around — every other structural choice (monorepo, one shell, canonical-module discipline, peer-module decomposition, vertical-configuration tier) is downstream of one principle: the consultant must see the workspace as one coherent thing. See [`PLATFORM-ARCHITECTURE.md`](PLATFORM-ARCHITECTURE.md) §4.0 "AI-consultant context principle (cornerstone)" for the reasoning.

- [`AI-CONSULTANT.md`](AI-CONSULTANT.md) — **Feature surface.** What the consultant is, what it can do today (registered tools by module), what it cannot do yet, how modules contribute tools, BYOK + paid-tier unlock, per-workspace operational memory.
- [`PLATFORM-ARCHITECTURE.md`](PLATFORM-ARCHITECTURE.md) §4.0, §4.3, §6, §7 — Architecture depth: cornerstone principle, AI-platform sub-system, tools + prompt composition + memory + worked example, BYOK monetization model.
- [`help/`](help/) — Operator-facing usage guides (see [`help/asking-umbraculum.md`](help/asking-umbraculum.md)).

## Stack & dependencies

*Audience: evaluators, future maintainers, partners — anyone who wants to know **what** the platform is built on and **why** each open-source choice was made.*

- [`OPEN-SOURCE-STACK.md`](OPEN-SOURCE-STACK.md) — **technology recap and per-dependency rationale.** Exhaustive companion to [`MANIFESTO.md`](../MANIFESTO.md) §1.4: for every load-bearing dependency (OS, runtime, data layer, backend, frontend web + native, validation, tests, lint, industrial automation, build, brewery-domain, docs/CI), answers three questions — role in the discipline-apparatus, why this over the proprietary alternative, what shrinks if swapped for closed source. Includes the single closed-source exception (Cursor itself) and the posture toward it.

- [`design/ecosystem-case-study-omnis.md`](design/ecosystem-case-study-omnis.md) — **Practitioner case study (Omnis Studio).** Good product, ecosystem never formed; Core/vertical dynamics and long-run migration fear (§3.4–§3.6); rewrite caution (§6).
- [`design/ecosystem-case-study-business-central.md`](design/ecosystem-case-study-business-central.md) — **Practitioner case study (Dynamics 365 Business Central).** Strong ERP and partner channel, painful external integration discovery (OData vs REST API v2.0, release waves, docs by topic not by job); senior consultants often cannot advise API consumers; maps to Umbraculum contracts packages, public route tables, version handshake, and alpha partial OpenAPI ([`API-OPENAPI.md`](API-OPENAPI.md) §4). Rewrite caution (§6).
- [`design/ecosystem-case-study-sap.md`](design/ecosystem-case-study-sap.md) — **Practitioner case study (SAP ABAP).** Repositioning in hard times; trials exist but are not a Magento-shaped safe boat; no Umbraculum certification counter-commitment. Rewrite caution (§6).
- [`design/ecosystem-case-study-teamsystem.md`](design/ecosystem-case-study-teamsystem.md) — **Practitioner case study (TeamSystem).** Partner-only experiment path; expertise trapped inside integrator channel. Rewrite caution (§6).
- [`design/ecosystem-case-study-odoo.md`](design/ecosystem-case-study-odoo.md) — **Practitioner case study (Odoo Community).** Partial positive on learnability; §4.1 Umbraculum vs Odoo platform-shape comparison; deliberate skip of certification economy. Rewrite caution (§5).
- [`design/ecosystem-case-study-adobe-magento.md`](design/ecosystem-case-study-adobe-magento.md) — **Practitioner case study (Adobe → Magento).** ece-tools deploy integration failure, agency bypass cost, untrue support (§3.5); Mage-OS fork. Rewrite caution (§7).
- [`design/ecosystem-case-study-drupal-wordpress.md`](design/ecosystem-case-study-drupal-wordpress.md) — **Practitioner case study (Drupal + WordPress).** Stewardship positives; WordPress horizontal hell; Drupal core/junior culture debate unsettled. Rewrite caution (§7).
- [`design/ecosystem-case-study-custom-vertical-code.md`](design/ecosystem-case-study-custom-vertical-code.md) — **Practitioner case study (unnamed platforms).** Delivery vs craft; custom code ~90% of upgrade pain; solidarity guardrail; client code-quality evaluation. Rewrite caution (§7).
- [`design/application-surfaces-vs-platform-backbone.md`](design/application-surfaces-vs-platform-backbone.md) — **Terminology + layering (2026-05-28).** What "backend" means in this repo; four product layers (platform backbone, modules, operator shell, optional audience-specific apps); Drupal-style admin/storefront vs ERP-style operator shell; `@umbraculum/module-sdk` as the backbone SDK vs the reserved/unused `@umbraculum/core` npm name.
- [`design/ubuntu-touch-shell-strategy.md`](design/ubuntu-touch-shell-strategy.md) — **Ubuntu Touch delivery (2026-05-31).** Decision-of-record: Lomiri Click webapp shell reuses `apps/web` + Tamagui (no Qt rewrite); OpenStore presence; online-first on UT; native offline guarantees remain iOS/Android-only. **Reference:** [`packaging/ubuntu-touch/umbraculum-reference/`](../packaging/ubuntu-touch/umbraculum-reference/README.md).
- [`design/canonical-workspace-billing-addons-surface.md`](design/canonical-workspace-billing-addons-surface.md) — **Workspace billing add-ons boundary ([RFC-0009](rfcs/0009-workspace-billing-addons-and-entitlements.md)).** `addonCodes` registry, `tier_only` vs `tier_and_addons` enforcement, H1 2027 implementation backlog; no `WorkspaceBillingAddon` table in public α.
- [`design/canonical-automation-module-surface.md`](design/canonical-automation-module-surface.md) — Canonical `automation` module surface (RFC-0001 Decision E §7.2): adapter SDK, Vessel vs EquipmentProfile, OpenPLC seam, AI tools, tier limits (**Accepted design** 2026-05-19; implementation phased per doc §9).
- [`design/web-route-group-audit.md`](design/web-route-group-audit.md) — **Decision-of-record for the web route-shape audit (Accepted 2026-05-21).** Ratifies the two β disciplines (no `(<code>)/page.tsx`, no `(<code>)/[<dynamic>]/page.tsx` at the route-group root), the URL-segment registry surface in `@umbraculum/module-sdk` (`registerWebModule({ ownedUrlSegments, navEntry })` + CI gate `scripts/check-web-url-segments.ts`), and the per-module URL corrections (`/en/automation` → `/en/vessels`, `/en/pim/*` → `/en/products` / `/en/categories` / `/en/attribute-sets`, brewery URLs preserved). Pairs with [RFC-0006](rfcs/0006-amend-rfc-0002-brewery-file-move-acceleration.md) (governance amendment to RFC-0002 D) and the Cursor plugin rule `46-web-route-shape.mdc` in `umbraculum-platform-tsjs-cursor-assistant` v0.5.0.

## Reference

*Audience: contributors, archaeology readers.*

- [`calculators/`](calculators/) — Calculator references and source materials (e.g. BrunWater spreadsheet, mash-pH paper).
- [`archive/`](archive/) — Superseded architecture revisions (Rev00, Rev01) and the canonical architecture-revision PDF (`archive/architecture-Rev02.pdf`). Kept for historical reference; not load-bearing for current decisions.

## Contributing to the documentation

- Documentation lives in this folder (`docs/`); top-level files (`DEVELOPMENT.md`, `DEVELOPMENT-LOCAL.md`, repository `README.md`) cover repo-level mechanics and link back here for everything platform-level.
- When adding a new document, also add a link to it from this index in the appropriate category. Each category is intended to stay small enough to scan.
- **URL moves and removals (non-negotiable).** When a published doc **moves** or is **removed** from the docs site (`docs.umbraculum.dev`), the same PR must include **either** a **permanent redirect** to the replacement URL **or** a deliberate stub page that **explains why the content no longer exists** and where readers should go instead. Silent 404s — bookmarks, forum posts, and colleague links that die without explanation — are **not acceptable**. In-repo relative links must be updated in the same change; site-level redirects cover external bookmarks to old URLs. Lesson from [`design/ecosystem-case-study-omnis.md`](design/ecosystem-case-study-omnis.md) §3.5.
- New documents should follow the existing tone: precise about decisions, honest about trade-offs, and explicit about what is *not* settled.
- For any document that may be surfaced publicly in the future (Vision & strategy, License, parts of Architecture), assume the audience is technically literate but not specialist, and define terms on first use.
- Substantive licensing or governance changes follow the RFC process described in [`LICENSING.md`](LICENSING.md) §10.

## Audience for this set

This documentation is written with three audiences in mind, in approximately this priority order:

1. **Future maintainers and contributors** — the people who will keep this project alive across decades. The docs are the durable artifact; the chat history is not.
2. **Self-hosting operators and platform evaluators** — technical decision-makers assessing Umbraculum as a long-term dependency.
3. **Prospective module developers** — partners building verticals or integrations on top of the platform.

If a document does not serve at least one of these audiences clearly, it should be revised or moved out of the docs tree.
